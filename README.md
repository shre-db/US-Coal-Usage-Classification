# US-Coal-Usage-Classification
This project is focused on analyzing coal usage in the United States from 2001 to 2021 and classifying coal using data gathered from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) through their API. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Geospatial Analysis, Chemometrics and coal production Time Series Analysis (only Trend). Transformation pipelines were implemented for convenient preprocessing of new data. Machine Learning algorithms like Softmax Regression, Decision Tree Classifer, Random Forest Classfier and Feed Forward Network were implemented and cross-validation was used to evaluate their performance. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve the performance of Feed Forward Network. Finally the project aims to deploy the trained models, although this step is not yet completed.
