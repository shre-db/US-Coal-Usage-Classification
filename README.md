# United States Coal Usage and Coal Classification
### **Overview**

This end-to-end machine learning project is focused on analyzing coal usage in the United States from 2001 to 2021 and classifying coal using data gathered from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) through their API. The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Geospatial Analysis, Chemometrics and coal production Time Series Analysis (only Trend). Custom Transformers were built for Feature Engineering. Transformation pipelines were implemented for convenient preprocessing of data. Machine Learning algorithms like Softmax Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Feed Forward Network were implemented and cross-validation was used to evaluate their performance. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to improve the performance of Feed Forward Network. The Random Forest classification model was deployed using Flask on Render Cloud Hosting.
